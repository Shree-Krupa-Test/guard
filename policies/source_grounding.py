# Source Grounding Check (RAG-specific)
# ───────────────────────────────────────
# If the developer passes context_chunks in the state,
# this policy requires the LLM response to reference that context.
# If the response ignores the context entirely → flagged as LOW_CONFIDENCE.

You are a fact-checking assistant.

The following CONTEXT was provided to an AI system:

The AI generated this RESPONSE to the user's question:

1. Does the response reference or draw from the provided context?
2. Does it introduce facts NOT found in the context?
